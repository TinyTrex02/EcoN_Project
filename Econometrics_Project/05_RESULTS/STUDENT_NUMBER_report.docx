## 1. Introduction and Research Question

This study investigates whether climate vulnerability significantly explains US excess stock market returns after controlling for traditional financial predictors. The research question is:

*Does climate vulnerability, as measured by the ND-GAIN Vulnerability Score, have a significant contemporaneous association with US excess stock returns when controlling for valuation and credit risk factors?*

Climate vulnerability has emerged as a potential macro-financial risk factor that may influence asset returns through increased economic uncertainty and higher risk premia (Batten et al., 2020; Kling et al., 2025).

## 2. Economic Reasoning and Model Specification

### 2.1 Model Specification

$$Excess\_Return_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Vuln_t + \beta_2 dp_t + \beta_3 dfr_t + \varepsilon_t$$

Where:
- **Excess_Return** = CRSP_SPvw - Rfree (monthly S&P 500 excess return)
- **Vuln** = USA ND-GAIN Vulnerability Score
- **dp** = Dividend-Price Ratio (D12/Index)
- **dfr** = Default Return Spread (corpr - ltr)

### 2.2 Expected Signs and Economic Justification

| Variable | Expected Sign | Economic Reasoning |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Vuln** | Negative (-) | Higher climate vulnerability increases economic uncertainty, elevating risk premia and reducing equity valuations (Batten et al., 2020) |
| **dp** | Positive (+) | From the Campbell-Shiller (1988) present value identity, high dividend-price ratios indicate undervaluation, predicting higher subsequent returns |
| **dfr** | Positive (+) | Corporate bonds outperforming government bonds signals improved risk appetite, benefiting equities (Fama & French, 1989) |

The dividend-price ratio is selected based on its strong theoretical foundation in the equity premium prediction literature (Goyal & Welch, 2008). The default return spread captures credit market dynamics that lead equity markets in pricing risk.

## 3. Data Description

### 3.1 Data Sources and Sample
- **Sample Period:** January 1995 - December 2020
- **Observations:** 312 monthly observations
- **Data Type:** Time series (single cross-sectional unit observed over time)

The ND-GAIN Vulnerability Score (annual) was extended to monthly frequency by assigning each year's value to all 12 months within that year. Financial variables were constructed from Goyal-Welch data following standard definitions.

### 3.2 Data Quality
- **Missing Values:** None detected; dataset is complete
- **Outlier Treatment:** No winsorization applied to preserve extreme market events (2008 crisis, COVID-19). Robustness checks with 1% and 5% winsorization confirm results are not outlier-driven.

### 3.3 Descriptive Statistics

| Variable | Mean | Std Dev | Min | Max |
|----------|------|---------|-----|-----|
| Excess_Return | 0.0076 | 0.0435 | -0.168 | 0.129 |
| Vuln | 0.3140 | 0.0030 | 0.307 | 0.317 |
| dp | 0.0187 | 0.0039 | 0.011 | 0.038 |
| dfr | 0.0002 | 0.0183 | -0.098 | 0.074 |

### 3.4 Limitations
- ND-GAIN data is annual, creating limited within-year variation
- USA vulnerability is low and stable (range: 0.307-0.317), potentially limiting detection of effects
- Contemporaneous specification tests association, not prediction

## 4. Regression Analysis

### 4.1 OLS Results with Robust Standard Errors (HC3)

| Variable | Coefficient | Robust SE | t-statistic | p-value |
|----------|-------------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Constant | 0.3922 | 0.240 | 1.634 | 0.102 |
| Vuln | -1.1618 | 0.727 | -1.598 | 0.110 |
| dp | -1.0713 | 1.098 | -0.975 | 0.329 |
| dfr | 1.1500 | 0.166 | 6.931 | 0.000*** |

*Significance: *** p<0.01*

### 4.2 Interpretation

**Partial Effects (Ceteris Paribus):**
- A one-unit increase in vulnerability is associated with a 1.16 percentage point decrease in monthly excess returns, holding dp and dfr constant. However, this effect is not statistically significant (p=0.110).
- The default return spread (dfr) has a highly significant positive effect: a 1 percentage point increase in dfr is associated with a 1.15 percentage point increase in excess returns, ceteris paribus.
- The dividend-price ratio shows a negative coefficient (-1.07), contrary to theoretical expectations, but is not statistically significant (p=0.329).

**Model Fit:**
- **R² = 0.2517** (25.17% of variance explained)
- **Adjusted R² = 0.2444**
- **F-statistic = 17.44** (p < 0.001)

The F-statistic rejects H₀: β₁ = β₂ = β₃ = 0, confirming the model has significant explanatory power overall, driven primarily by dfr.

**Omitted Variable Bias:** Potentially omitted variables include market volatility (VIX), momentum factors, and default yield spread (dfy). Including dp and dfr captures valuation and credit channels, mitigating bias in the vulnerability coefficient.

## 5. Diagnostic Tests

### 5.1 Multicollinearity (VIF)

| Variable | VIF |
|----------|-----|
| Vuln | 1.11 |
| dp | 1.11 |
| dfr | 1.00 |

**Result:** All VIF < 10. No multicollinearity concerns.

### 5.2 Normality of Residuals

| Test | Statistic | p-value | Decision |
|------|-----------|---------|----------|
| Jarque-Bera | 56.83 | 0.000 | Reject H₀ |
| Shapiro-Wilk | 0.9774 | 0.000 | Reject H₀ |

**Result:** Residuals are not normally distributed. However, with n=312, OLS remains consistent by the Central Limit Theorem. Robust standard errors ensure valid inference.

*Advantages:* Jarque-Bera tests skewness and kurtosis jointly; Shapiro-Wilk is powerful for small samples.
*Limitations:* Both may over-reject in large samples.

### 5.3 Heteroskedasticity

| Test | Statistic | p-value | Decision |
|------|-----------|---------|----------|
| Breusch-Pagan | 28.33 | 0.000 | Reject H₀ |
| White | 79.97 | 0.000 | Reject H₀ |

**Result:** Heteroskedasticity detected. **Action:** HC3 robust standard errors applied throughout.

*Advantages:* Breusch-Pagan is computationally simple; White makes no functional form assumption.
*Limitations:* Breusch-Pagan assumes linear variance relationship; White estimates many parameters, reducing power in small samples.

### 5.4 Autocorrelation

| Test | Statistic | p-value | Decision |
|------|-----------|---------|----------|
| Durbin-Watson | 2.09 | - | No autocorrelation (≈2) |
| Breusch-Godfrey (4 lags) | 1.71 | 0.790 | Fail to reject H₀ |

**Result:** No significant autocorrelation detected.

*Advantages:* Durbin-Watson is simple and widely used; Breusch-Godfrey tests higher-order autocorrelation and remains valid with lagged dependent variables.
*Limitations:* Durbin-Watson only tests AR(1) and has an inconclusive zone.

## 6. Recession Analysis and Structural Breaks

### 6.1 Recession Dummy Variable

A recession dummy was created based on NBER dates (2001 Dot-com, 2007-2009 GFC, 2020 COVID). An interaction term (Vuln × Recession) tests whether vulnerability effects differ during recessions.

| Variable | Coefficient | p-value |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Vuln | -0.5808 | 0.389 |
| Recession | 1.2550 | 0.650 |
| Vuln × Recession | -4.0437 | 0.644 |

**Interpretation:** The interaction term is insignificant (p=0.644), indicating no significant difference in the vulnerability effect during recessions versus expansions. The marginal effect of vulnerability during recessions (-4.62) is larger in magnitude than during expansions (-0.58), but imprecisely estimated.

### 6.2 Structural Break Tests (Chow Test)

| Break Point | F-statistic | p-value | Decision |
|-------------|-------------|---------|----------|
| March 2000 (Dot-com) | 3.10 | 0.016** | Break detected |
| September 2008 (Lehman) | 4.09 | 0.003*** | Break detected |
| March 2020 (COVID) | 0.87 | 0.480 | No break |

**Result:** Structural breaks are detected at March 2000 (p=0.016) and September 2008 (p=0.003), coinciding with major market crises. This suggests the relationship between predictors and returns may have shifted during these periods. The COVID-19 period shows no significant break, possibly due to the small post-break sample (10 observations).

## 7. Conclusion

Climate vulnerability, as measured by the ND-GAIN Index, does **not** significantly explain monthly US excess stock returns (p=0.110) after controlling for the dividend-price ratio and default return spread. The default return spread is the only significant predictor (p<0.001), consistent with Fama & French (1989) and Goyal & Welch (2008).

Structural break analysis reveals coefficient instability around the Dot-com crash (2000) and Global Financial Crisis (2008), suggesting time-varying relationships between financial predictors and returns.

This null finding for climate vulnerability may reflect: (1) climate risk already priced into US markets, (2) insufficient variation in US vulnerability scores (range of only 1 percentage point), (3) annual ND-GAIN data lacking monthly granularity, or (4) climate effects operating over longer horizons than monthly returns capture.
